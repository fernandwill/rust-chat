# WebSocket Chat Server - Test Instructions

## What was fixed:

### Server (server.rs):
- ✅ Added proper handling for all WebSocket message types
- ✅ Added Ping/Pong handling to keep connections alive
- ✅ Added proper Close frame handling
- ✅ Added Binary message support
- ✅ Better error handling and logging

### Client (client.rs):
- ✅ Changed from raw TCP to proper WebSocket protocol
- ✅ Added proper message handling for all WebSocket frame types
- ✅ Added graceful disconnect with Close frames
- ✅ Better error handling and user experience

### HTML Client (client.html):
- ✅ Enhanced with connection status indicators
- ✅ Added proper event handlers for all WebSocket events
- ✅ Added styling and better UX
- ✅ Added Enter key support for sending messages
- ✅ Added disconnect functionality

### Dependencies (Cargo.toml):
- ✅ Added `url` crate for WebSocket URL parsing
- ✅ Fixed server binary path

## How to test:

1. **Start the server:**
   ```
   cargo run --bin server
   ```

2. **Test with Rust client:**
   ```
   cargo run --bin client
   ```

3. **Test with HTML client:**
   - Open `client.html` in a web browser
   - Should connect automatically

## The connection closing issue should now be resolved because:
- Server properly responds to Ping frames (keeps connection alive)
- Server handles Close frames correctly
- Client uses proper WebSocket protocol instead of raw TCP
- All WebSocket message types are handled appropriately
